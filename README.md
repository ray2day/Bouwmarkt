.NET assignment
A .NET assignment (partly succeeded) made on behalf of a recruitment agency / potential employer.

An ASP.NET (C#) Web Application built using Entity Framework based on Code-first / Database-first using MS SQL database. With this I set up the foundation of the application using the CRUD principle where you can add / edit and remove shops. Unfortunately I was not able to implement the real functionality of the progam in time which was about the management of shopping Sundays.
