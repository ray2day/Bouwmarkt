# Bouwmarkt
Assignment to built a ASP.NET (C#) Web Application management system for a hardware store to keep track of shopping Sundays.

Using Entity Framework based on Code-first / Database-first using MS SQL database I set up the foundation to communicate with the database using CRUD operations for adding / editing and removing shops.

The code is fine and works but is not finished at all. Later on I rewrote the code to match the original assignment (see: Bouwmarkt API).
