# Bouwmarkt
My first assignment. The assignment was to built a ASP.NET (C#) Web Application management system for a hardware store to keep track of shopping Sundays.

Using Entity Framework based on Code-first / Database-first using MS SQL database I set up the foundation to communicate with the database using CRUD operations for adding / editing and removing shops.

The code works, but is not complete. Later on I rewrote the code (see: Bouwmarkt API) to match the original assignment (no frontend implementation / testable with Swagger).
