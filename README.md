# Bouwmarkt
.NET case
A .NET case (partly succeeded) made on behalf of a recruitment agency / potential employer.

An ASP.NET (C#) Web Application built using Entity Framework based on Code-first / Database-first using MS SQL database and by using this I set up the foundation of the application using the CRUD principle. Unfortunately I was not able to implement the real functionality of the progam which was about shopping Sundays.
